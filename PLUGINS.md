## Maintenance Notes

- If a plugin is added, renamed, or removed, update this file from the plugin metadata rather than editing counts by hand.
- Prefer keeping `id`, category, safety level, and dependency names aligned with each plugin's `metadata.json`.
## Checksum Maintenance

Plugin metadata files include integrity checksums. If you edit a plugin's
`metadata.json` or `parser.py`, you must refresh the checksum before committing
or the backend will reject the plugin during load and unrelated backend tests
will fail.

Use the helper script to refresh checksums:

```bash
# Refresh a single plugin after editing it
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --plugin <plugin-id>

# Example
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --plugin nmap

# Refresh all plugins at once
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --all

# Preview what would change without writing anything
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --all --dry-run
```

Run this script any time you:
- Edit a plugin's `metadata.json` fields
- Edit a plugin's `parser.py`
- Add a new plugin

After refreshing, run the backend tests to confirm the plugin loads correctly:

```bash
cd backend && python -m pytest
```
